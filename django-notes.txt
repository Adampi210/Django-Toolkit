Setting up the virtual environment:
	1. cd into the desired directory where the environment will be set up
	2. use: virtualenv -p python3 . to create the virtual environment (name same as the directory name)
	3. use: source bin/activate to activate the environment (or cd to bin and use activate)
	4. now one can work in the environment - install packages, etc.
		4.1 - to install Django use command: pip install Django
		4.2 - to start a new project navigate to a desired folder in which the projects are
					and use command: django-admin startproject projectname
	5. use deactivate to exit the environment

Using Django:
	- django-admin: allows for more things than just starting a new project
	- python manage.py runserver: gives useful things about the project
	-

Apps:
	- Apps in Django are components of the whole project - they hold code but they are not
		like the regular apps on the phones
